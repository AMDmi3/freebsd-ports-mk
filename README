This is a collection of patches for ports/Mk directory of FreeBSD
portstree, which I for some reason don't feel like submitting because
they are unfinished or are just concepts.

Each patch is stored in a separate branch, and (WARNING!) those
branches will be rebased onto upstream to avoid history pollution
with merge commits, so be careful if you clone/fork this repo.

Patches currently include:

  cmake-no-extra-flags
    prevents CMake from adding extra C/CXX flags when building
    ports. We set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to either release and debug
    based on WITH_DEBUG (and even if we don't do some software
    force build type), and thus cmake adds "-O3 -DNDEBUG" or
    "-O0 -g" acordingly. Ports/build systems should not tamper
    with system compiler flags, however in this case it's not
    a big problem so I doubt the patch is needed

  install-as-user
    when INSTALL_AS_USER is defined, places PORTS_DBDIR and PKG_DBDIR
    in user's home (~/.ports, ~/.pkgdb), allowing user to use
    ports system to the full extent without root privileges

  ldflags
    add LDFLAGS to MAKE_ARGS/CONFIGURE_ARGS as it was done with CPPFLAGS

  local-patchdir
    allows user to specify local directory with custom patches which
    are applied after patches from ${PORTDIR}/files. This is hacky
    and unsafe, as patches may break when the port is updated

  show-configlog
    if configure fails, displays its config.log, which is very useful
    for debugging build failures. Whether to display config.log is
    based on whether BATCH is set, and I doubt it's the best solution
    (is there another varible which is set on pointyhat/in tinderbox?
    or should we use e.g. VERBOSE_BUILD which is set there and which
    also turns on VERBOSE more for cmake)

  src_base
    convenient way to show that the port uses system/kernel sources
    (/usr/src). Checks whether source is present, allows to not hardcode
    /usr/src and also compares source version with version of running
    system (that is, not to accidentally build a module for another
    kernel version)

  stack-protector
    allows to add -fstack-protector to compiler flags, optionally
    in a manner similar to MAKE_JOBS

Some of these have been rotting in my CVS checkout since 2008, so may
be outdated or already (partially) implemented.
